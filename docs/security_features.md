## Container Security Scanning

Hivemind includes a comprehensive container security scanning system that helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in container images.

### Features

- **Image Vulnerability Scanning**: Scans container images for known vulnerabilities using a built-in vulnerability database.
- **Container Runtime Security Checks**: Monitors running containers for suspicious activities and security violations.
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Enforces security policies for container images and runtime behavior.
- **Security Event Logging and Alerting**: Logs security events and sends alerts for critical security issues.

### Usage

```rust
// Scan a container image
let scan_result = security_manager.scan_container_image("nginx:latest", "image-id").await?;

// Check if an image is compliant with security policies
let is_compliant = security_manager.check_image_compliance(&scan_result).await?;

// Perform a runtime security check on a container
let runtime_check = security_manager.check_container_runtime("container-id").await?;
```

### Security Policies

Security policies define the security requirements for container images and runtime behavior. Policies can be configured to:

- Block images with vulnerabilities of a certain severity level
- Whitelist or blacklist specific CVEs
- Restrict allowed container registries
- Require specific labels on container images
- Define runtime security rules

## Network Policies Enforcement

Hivemind provides fine-grained network access control through network policies that define how containers can communicate with each other.

### Features

- **Network Policy Enforcement**: Controls traffic flow between containers based on defined policies.
- **Fine-grained Network Access Control**: Allows or denies traffic based on source, destination, protocol, and port.
- **Network Traffic Encryption**: Encrypts network traffic between containers for sensitive communications.
- **Network Security Monitoring**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and policy violations.

### Usage

```rust
// Check if network traffic is allowed between containers
let is_allowed = security_manager.is_network_traffic_allowed(
    "source-container",
    "destination-container",
    Protocol::TCP,
    80,
).await?;
```

### Enhanced Network Policies

Hivemind extends the basic network policies with additional security features:

- **Traffic Encryption**: Requires encryption for sensitive traffic.
- **Traffic Logging**: Logs network traffic for auditing and monitoring.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Detects and alerts on suspicious network activities.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Hivemind implements a comprehensive RBAC system to control access to resources and operations within the platform.

### Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Authenticates users and authorizes access to resources.
- **Role and Permission Management**: Defines roles with specific permissions and assigns them to users.
- **Group-based Access Control**: Organizes users into groups for easier permission management.
- **Audit Logging**: Logs all authentication and authorization events for auditing.

### Usage

```rust
// Authenticate a user
let auth_response = security_manager.authenticate_user("username", "password").await?;

// Check if a user has permission to perform an action
let has_permission = security_manager.check_permission(
    "user-id",
    "container",
    "create",
    &PermissionScope::Global,
).await?;
```

### Permissions

Permissions in Hivemind are defined by:

- **Resource**: The type of resource being accessed (e.g., container, service, volume).
- **Action**: The operation being performed (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
- **Scope**: The scope of the permission (global, namespace, or specific resource).

## Secret Management

Hivemind provides secure storage and distribution of secrets to containers.

### Features

- **Secure Secret Storage**: Encrypts and securely stores sensitive information.
- **Secret Distribution to Containers**: Securely distributes secrets to containers as files or environment variables.
- **Secret Rotation and Versioning**: Supports rotating secrets and maintaining version history.
- **Encryption Key Management**: Manages encryption keys for securing secrets.

### Usage

```rust
// Create a secret
let secret = security_manager.create_secret(
    "secret-name",
    "Secret description",
    secret_data,
    "user-id",
    labels,
    metadata,
    expiration,
    rotation_period,
).await?;

// Mount a secret to a container
let reference = security_manager.mount_secret_to_container(
    "secret-id",
    "container-id",
    "/mnt/secrets",
    Some("ENV_VAR_NAME"),
    Some("filename"),
    Some(0o600),
    "user-id",
).await?;
```

### Secret Encryption

Secrets are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms:

- AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption
- RSA for asymmetric encryption
- Key rotation is performed periodically to maintain security

## Integration with External Security Tools

Hivemind is designed to integrate with external security tools for enhanced security capabilities:

- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Integration with tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore for container image scanning.
- **Runtime Security Monitoring**: Integration with tools like Falco for runtime security monitoring.
- **Network Security Tools**: Integration with tools like Suricata or Zeek for network security monitoring.
- **Authentication Providers**: Integration with external authentication providers like LDAP, OAuth, or SAML.

## Security Best Practices

When using Hivemind, follow these security best practices:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Start with minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.
2. **Scan Images Regularly**: Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities.
3. **Apply Least Privilege Principle**: Grant minimal permissions required for each user and container.
4. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Use network policies to segment container communications.
5. **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: Set up automatic rotation for secrets.
6. **Enable Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging for all security-related events.
7. **Monitor Container Runtime**: Implement runtime security monitoring for containers.
8. **Keep Hivemind Updated**: Regularly update Hivemind to get the latest security fixes.
