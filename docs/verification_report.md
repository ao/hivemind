## Zero-Downtime Rolling Updates Verification

### Implementation Details

The zero-downtime rolling updates feature has been successfully implemented in the `src/deployment.rs` file. The implementation includes:

1. **Batch-based deployment**: Updates containers in configurable batch sizes
2. **Health verification**: Verifies new containers are healthy before proceeding
3. **Traffic shifting**: Gradually shifts traffic to new containers
4. **Connection draining**: Allows existing connections to complete before removing old containers
5. **Automated rollback**: Automatically rolls back if health checks fail

### Verification Process

The zero-downtime rolling updates feature has been verified through:

1. **Unit tests**: Testing individual components of the implementation
2. **Integration tests**: Testing the entire deployment process
3. **Performance tests**: Testing under load to ensure zero downtime
4. **Chaos tests**: Testing resilience during network partitions and node failures

### Test Results

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests | ✅ Pass | All components function as expected |
| Integration tests | ✅ Pass | End-to-end deployment process works correctly |
| Performance tests | ✅ Pass | No downtime observed during updates |
| Chaos tests | ✅ Pass | System recovers correctly from failures |

### Documentation

The zero-downtime rolling updates feature is fully documented in:

1. **User documentation**: `docs/advanced_deployments.md`
2. **API documentation**: `docs/api_reference.md`
3. **CLI documentation**: `docs/cli_reference.md`

### Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Status | Verification |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| No service interruption during updates | ✅ Met | Verified through performance tests |
| Health checking before traffic shifting | ✅ Met | Implemented and tested |
| Connection draining | ✅ Met | Implemented and tested |
| Configurable batch sizes | ✅ Met | Implemented and tested |
| Automated rollback on failure | ✅ Met | Implemented and tested |

## Conclusion

All features of the Hivemind container orchestration platform have been successfully implemented, tested, and documented. The zero-downtime rolling updates feature, which was the final feature to be implemented, meets all requirements and is working as expected.

The platform is now feature-complete and ready for production use.
