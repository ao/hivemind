## Implementation Summary

### Resource Usage Tracking

#### Technical Approach
Resource usage tracking was implemented through a comprehensive monitoring system that collects metrics from containers and nodes, storing them for analysis and enforcement of quotas.

#### Key Components
- **Tenant Manager**: Tracks resource allocation and usage per tenant
- **Resource Metrics Collector**: Gathers CPU, memory, storage, and network usage data
- **Usage Database**: Stores historical usage data for analysis and billing

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the container runtime to collect container-level metrics
- Connected to the node manager to gather node-level resource utilization
- Linked to the tenant quota enforcement system to provide usage data for quota decisions

### Container and Service Quota Enforcement

#### Technical Approach
Quota enforcement was implemented using a two-tier approach: tenant-level quotas and application-level quotas. The system performs pre-checks before resource allocation and maintains ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance.

#### Key Components
- **TenantQuotaEnforcer**: Enforces tenant-level quotas for containers and services
- **AppManagerWithQuota**: Extends the AppManager with quota enforcement capabilities
- **Quota Alert System**: Provides warnings when approaching quota limits

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the app deployment workflow to check quotas before container creation
- Connected to the service discovery system to track service registrations
- Linked to the monitoring system to provide alerts on quota usage

### Network Policy Enforcement

#### Technical Approach
Network policy enforcement was implemented using a controller-based approach that translates high-level network policies into actual network rules. The system supports both ingress and egress rules with various actions.

#### Key Components
- **NetworkPolicyManager**: Manages network policies at a high level
- **NetworkPolicyController**: Translates policies to actual network rules
- **Policy Violation Logging**: Records and reports policy violations

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the container runtime to apply rules when containers start
- Connected to the network manager to implement overlay network rules
- Linked to the security monitoring system to report violations

### Tenant Network Initialization Consistency

#### Technical Approach
Tenant network initialization was enhanced to ensure consistency and isolation between tenant networks. The implementation includes validation of network configurations, prevention of overlapping CIDRs, and automatic retry mechanisms.

#### Key Components
- **NetworkManager**: Initializes and manages tenant networks
- **NetworkValidator**: Validates network configurations for consistency
- **Retry Mechanism**: Handles transient failures during network initialization

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the tenant manager to create networks when tenants are created
- Connected to the network overlay system to establish isolated networks
- Linked to the service discovery system to enable cross-network communication

### Proxy Server in Service Discovery

#### Technical Approach
A proxy server was integrated into the service discovery system to provide advanced routing, load balancing, and resilience features. The proxy acts as an intermediary between clients and services, enhancing reliability and security. The implementation uses proper logging, monitoring integration, and resilience patterns to ensure robust operation.

#### Key Components
- **Service Discovery Proxy**: Routes requests to appropriate service endpoints based on domain or path
- **Load Balancing Strategies**: Implements various algorithms for request distribution (round-robin, weighted, least connections)
- **Health Checking**: Monitors endpoint health and routes traffic only to healthy instances
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Prevents cascading failures by detecting failing services
- **Request Metrics Collection**: Gathers detailed metrics on request patterns and performance
- **Tenant Boundary Enforcement**: Ensures requests respect tenant isolation boundaries

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the DNS server for service name resolution
- Connected to the health monitoring system to track endpoint health
- Linked to the resilience patterns for circuit breaking and retries
- Integrated with the logging system for proper request/response logging
- Connected to external monitoring systems for metrics reporting

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

#### Technical Approach
The circuit breaker pattern was implemented to prevent cascading failures by detecting when a service is failing and temporarily stopping requests to it. The implementation includes state management, metrics collection, and automatic recovery.

#### Key Components
- **CircuitBreaker**: Core implementation with state management
- **CircuitBreakerStorage**: Persists circuit breaker state and metrics
- **CircuitBreakerMetrics**: Collects and analyzes failure patterns

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the service discovery system to prevent routing to failing services
- Connected to the health monitoring system to detect service failures
- Linked to the logging and metrics systems for observability

### Tenant-Specific Storage Isolation

#### Technical Approach
Storage isolation was implemented to ensure that data from different tenants remains separate and secure. The implementation includes access controls, encryption, and quality of service management.

#### Key Components
- **StorageAccessControl**: Manages access permissions for volumes
- **StorageEncryptionManager**: Provides tenant-specific encryption
- **StorageQoSManager**: Enforces storage performance limits per tenant

#### Integration Points
- Integrated with the volume management system to enforce isolation
- Connected to the tenant manager to apply tenant-specific policies
- Linked to the security auditing system to log access attempts

## Testing and Validation
