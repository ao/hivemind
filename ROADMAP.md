## Conclusion

⚠️ **PROJECT STATUS**: Approximately 50% of planned features have been implemented, with several key components requiring additional work.

The Hivemind project has made good progress on its roadmap, implementing core functionality and some advanced features. The implementation has focused first on core functionality, with a solid foundation for container management, basic service discovery, and networking.

While some features are fully implemented, many components are partially implemented or still in the planning stage. The project has a strong foundation with the container runtime integration, web interface, and basic orchestration capabilities, but advanced features like cloud provider integration, CI/CD integration, and Helm chart support are still planned for future development.

For a comprehensive overview of the current project status, please refer to:

- **Architecture Guide**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Hivemind Overview**: `hivemind.md`

The project continues to work toward delivering on its core value proposition: **"Kubernetes-level features with Docker Compose-level simplicity"** while ensuring production-ready reliability and performance. With focused effort on the remaining work items, the project can reach full production readiness.
