   - Fallback: Host networking mode

3. **Distributed State Management**
   - Mitigation: Use proven algorithms (Raft, SWIM)
   - Fallback: Single-node mode

### Resource Constraints
1. **Development Time**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize core features first
   - Contingency: Extend timeline for non-critical features

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Mitigation: Use container-based testing
   - Contingency: Manual testing for complex scenarios

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing Hivemind's implementation. The focus is on delivering core functionality first, then building advanced features that differentiate Hivemind from other container orchestration platforms.

The key success factor is maintaining the project's core value proposition: **"Kubernetes-level features with Docker Compose-level simplicity"** while ensuring production-ready reliability and performance.
